# DSA

This Repository aims to simplify Data Structure and Algorithms Coding Interview for students, freshers and experienced people

DSA basically means data structure and algorithms. It has various sub-types to solve problems using the inherent memory of the system/server where the program is running.
Data Structure, as the name suggests, It is structure which can hold data in different ways.

Algorithms means a set of steps which when followed chronologically or in some logic, will produce an output which is desirable to solve a problem.
